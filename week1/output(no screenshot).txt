Exercise 1:
    1. IPv4 address: 65.8.134.9、65.8.134.89、65.8.134.70 和 65.8.134.47
    what is the reason for having several IP addresses as an output?
        This is similar to the Frequency Division Multiplexing mentioned in Lecture1
        (FDM) has the same concept of resource allocation and utilization.
        The output of multiple IP addresses is usually because the website 
        uses load balancing technology. Load balancing technology is used to 
        distribute network traffic to different servers to improve performance, 
        reliability, and scalability.
    2.The name of IP address 127.0.0.1 is localhost. 
    What's special about this IP address is that it is the local loopback 
    address used to route network traffic back to the local computer. 

Exercise 2:
    www.google.co.uk        Yes. We Can Ping.
    www.columbia.edu        Yes. We Can Ping.
    www.wikipedia.org       Yes. We Can Ping.
    ec.ho                   No, we cant ping because Host/Web address does not exist.
    hhh.gs                  Yes. We Can Ping.
    defence.gov.au          No, we cant ping because firewall doesnt allow us to access.
    yes.no                  Yes. We Can Ping.
    一.一.一.一              No, we cant ping because Host/Web address is https://one.one.one.one/ (we can acess from web) not 一.一.一.一
    theguardian.com         Yes. We Can Ping.
    xn--i-7iq.ws            Yes. We Can Ping.

Exercise 3:
    1. 
        1.There are 21 routers between your workstation and usi.ch.
        There are 5 routers along the way that are part of the UNSW network. (we can use whois host command to check).
        2. ae2.mx1.lon2.uk.geant.net (62.40.98.65) is the first router outside AU.
        3. ae2.mx1.lon2.uk.geant.net (62.40.98.65) is the first router in Europe.
    2.  1.138.44.5.0
        Is't Australian Academic and Research Network，AARNet 's IP address
        2. The relationship between hop count and physical distance is not a simple proportional relationship
        Network topology, routing policies, traffic optimization and other factors will affect path selection, 
        so the relationship between hop count and physical distance is not linear. In some cases, 
        due to network optimization or other factors, the hop count may decrease rather than increase, 
        even as the physical distance increases.
    3.  
        1. www.linkwan.com  www.telstra.net
        2. Both forward and reverse paths go through the same router node 138.44.5.0
        3. The same IP address 138.44.5.0 was observed on both forward and reverse paths.
        This indicates that packets pass through the same router nodes as they enter and leave your network.

Exercise 4:
    1.  Physical distance from UNSW to Charles Darwin University, Darwin, Australia: 375.64 km 233.41 miles
    time cost is : distance / speed of light = 375640 / (3*10^8) = 1.2521ms
        Physical distance from UNSW to Universidade de São Paulo (USP),Sao Paulo,Brazil: 13490.89 km 8382.85 miles
    time cost is : distance / speed of light = 13490890 / (3*10^8) = 44.963ms
        Physical distance from UNSW to The University of Edinburgh - Edinburgh, Scotland, UK: 16880.66 km10489.15 miles
    time cost is : distance / speed of light = 16880660 / (3*10^-8) = 56.269ms

    3.  Network congestion: During times of high network load, packets may take longer 
        to reach their destination and return, resulting in increased latency.

        Network routing selection: Data packets may pass through multiple routing nodes 
        during transmission. If the selected routing path is long or there is congestion, 
        the transmission time of the data packet will be increased.
    4.  Delays to destinations often vary over time.
        Network congestion: When traffic in a network increases, such as during peak hours or during network outages, 
        packets may experience longer wait times to reach their destination.

        Routing: Routers in a network may choose different paths to transmit packets based 
        on current network conditions. Some paths may be more efficient than others, while others may cause 
        increased latency.
    5.  depend on the packet size: Transmission Delay  Processing Delay
        not depend on the packet size: Propagation Delay  Queueing Delay
